# Kubernetes Cost Optimization: $560K in Savings

## Executive Summary

Through strategic system topology optimization and intelligent resource management, we achieved $560K in total savings across FY23-24. This case study details our approach to enterprise Kubernetes cost optimization.

## The Cost Challenge

Our Kubernetes infrastructure was growing rapidly:

- **200+ microservices** across multiple clusters
- **50+ development teams** with varying resource needs
- **Multi-cloud deployment** (GCP, AWS, on-premises)
- **24/7 workloads** with unpredictable traffic patterns

Cost optimization became critical as our cloud spend approached $2M annually.

## Our Optimization Strategy

### 1. Resource Right-Sizing

**Problem**: Over-provisioned containers consuming unnecessary resources.

**Solution**: Implemented intelligent resource profiling:
