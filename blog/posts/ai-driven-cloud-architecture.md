# AI-Driven Cloud Architecture: Lessons from the Trenches

## Introduction

Over the past year, I've led the integration of AI tools throughout our development lifecycle at UKG, resulting in remarkable productivity gains. Here's what we learned implementing AI-assisted development at enterprise scale.

## The Challenge

Traditional development workflows were becoming bottlenecks as our cloud infrastructure grew more complex. We needed to:

- Accelerate code review processes
- Reduce debugging time for distributed systems
- Automate documentation generation
- Improve testing coverage and quality

## Our AI Integration Strategy

### 1. AI-Assisted Code Review

We implemented AI-powered code analysis that:
